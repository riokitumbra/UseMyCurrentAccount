# UseMyCurrentAccount

This version has not been published to the Edge Extension Store, and instead needs to be manually added. You can install
the original version of the extension in the [Edge Extension Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hbfacnnpimgddoojjaonnnbeljegicfl)

If you have multiple "Connected to Windows" accounts, you'll be prompted to pick which account 
every time you access a site that requires a login.

This extension will skip that screen by using your Edge profile account by default.

The recommended way to use this is to use a separate profile in Edge for each AAD account you have and install
this extension in each profile. Then go to the site you want in the profile you want and you won't be prompted to login.

If you want to choose a different account, you can disable the functionality by clicking on the toolbar icon.
